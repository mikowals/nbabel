## Alternative implementations of the Julia version

`nbabel.jl` is the implementation mentioned in the main README.

The `nbabel4` implementations use a custom Particle struct with 4 Float64 fields
to maximize the performance of SIMD operations.

`nbabel4_serial.jl`: only runs in serial.

`nbabel4_threads.jl`: runs with one or multiple processors. (use the `-tN` flag)

Benchmarks measure the time reported by system time, as output by the `Makefile`
commands.

`@inbounds` flags are added to O(N^2) loops, but the benchmark appears to be
somewhat dependent on bounds checking anyway, particularly for the parallel
version, which allocates larger arrays for non-concurrent sums. Thus, two
benchmarks were performed, with and without a global flag to avoid bounds
checking.

[This page of the Julia forum](https://discourse.julialang.org/t/nbabel-nbody-integrator-speed-up)
shows the work done for these optimized implementations.

### Single-threaded in a Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-8550U CPU @ 1.80GHz

With julia flags `-O3 --check-bounds=no`:

| # particles | nbabel.jl | nbabel_serial.jl | nbabel4_threads.jl |
| ----------- | --------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| 1024        | 50.2      | 31.1             | 34.4               |
| 2048        | 201.5     | 120.1            | 109.3              |

With julia flag `-O3` only:

| # particles | nbabel.jl | nbabel_serial.jl | nbabel4_threads.jl |
| ----------- | --------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| 1024        | 48.1      | 28.0             | 36.6               |
| 2048        | 188.5     | 111.8            | 147.7              |

### With 4 processors (the laptop has 4):

With julia flags `-O3 --check-bounds=no -t4`:

| # particles | nbabel4_threads.jl |
| ----------- | ------------------ |
| 1024        | 19.9               |
| 2048        | 82.1               |

With julia flags `-O3` only:

| # particles | nbabel4_threads.jl |
| ----------- | ------------------ |
| 1024        | 24.9               |
| 2048        | 91.7               |

- Differences smaller than about 10% are probably not significant.

## Requirements

All versions require the `DelimitedFiles` package. Install with:

```julia
julia> ] add DelimitedFiles

```

(Julia version 1.5 or greater is recommended)
